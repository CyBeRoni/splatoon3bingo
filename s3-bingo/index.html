    <h2>Stream Version</h2>
    <p>This Weapons Bingo Card generator is based heavily on that by Go1den, but modified for visuals.</p>
    <p>To use, create an OBS Browser source (minimum size: 1920x1080) and enter the URL. <br/>If custom positioning is desired, do this in a browser and copy the resulting URL after, as the Browser Source will not save this. Crop out the settings area in OBS. Right-click and choose "interact" to be able to press the buttons.</p>
