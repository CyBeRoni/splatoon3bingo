    <h1>Splatoon 3 Weapons Bingo</h1>
    <h2>Marco's Stream Version</h2>
    <p>This Weapons Bingo Card generator is based heavily on that by Go1den, but modified for visuals.</p>
    <p>To use, create an OBS Browser source (minimum size: 1920x1080) and enter the URL. If custom positioning
         is desired, do this in a browser and copy the resulting URL after, as the Browser Source will not save this between launches of OBS.
         Crop out the settings area in OBS. Right-click and choose "interact" to be able to press the buttons.</p>
    <p>Tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Making the browser source 2300 pixels wide allows you to position the settings area off-screen</li>
        <li>If you keep the "seed" parameter in the URL, the board will start with the same contents every time. Removing it will let OBS generate a new board every time you launch it.</li>
        <li>If you hide the weapon randomizer and click either of the randomizers's buttons, it will show for 10 seconds and then hide again.</li>
        <li>To avoid having to use "interact", there's an OBS dock you can add as well.</li>
        </ul>
